## 📋 Changelog

### 🎉 Version 1.0.4 (Latest)
- 🔐 **Admin Permission Reliability**:
  - Added robust effective permission checks for menu/command access
  - Improved `css_addadmin` handling for flag/group normalization
  - Added `css_adminreload` command for manual admin data refresh
- 🚫 **Ban Enforcement Hardening**:
  - Added repeated post-connect ban rechecks to block reconnect bypass attempts
  - Added extra early/late recheck stages for high-population server timing windows
  - Added smart ban cache refresh based on file change timestamps
  - Added clearer blocked-ban connect/console notifications
- 🔇 **Mute/Gag Persistence Hardening**:
  - Added file change detection for `communication_data.json` to reload manual edits safely
  - Re-applies punishments on connect/team/chat enforcement paths to avoid reconnect bypass
- ⚙️ **Auto File Bootstrap**:
  - Plugin now auto-creates required data/config files on load when missing
  - Improved resilience for empty/first-run JSON files
- 🔗 **Discord Improvements**:
  - Server address now uses dynamic `ip:hostport` detection (no fixed `27015`)
  - Online admin count now uses effective admin permission checks
- 🎮 **Fun Command Behavior Fixes**:
  - `css_freeze`: movement lock behavior refined
  - `css_drug`: camera lock/forced look behavior improved
- 🌍 **Localization Redesign**:
  - Unified prefix usage to a single `Prefix` key
  - Reworked user-facing messages to modern, clearer, game-friendly wording
  - Improved plural wording (`<multiple>` keys) and readability consistency
  - Added and synchronized missing translation keys across all supported languages
  - Added **Brazilian Portuguese** (`pt-BR`) language file
- 🧩 **Compatibility Update**:
  - Updated CounterStrikeSharp API package to `1.0.364`
- 🛠️ **General Stability & Performance**:
  - Added periodic cleanup improvements for report cooldown tracking dictionaries
  - Included multiple compatibility and reliability fixes from community feedback

#### 🔒 Ban & Communication Security Flow (No Database)
- **Ban check stages**: authorization -> connect-full -> spawn -> scheduled rechecks (`0.10`, `0.30`, `0.50`, `1.0`, `1.5`, `3.0`, `6.0`, `10.0` seconds)
- **Manual file edits supported**:
  - Ban files (`banned_user.cfg`, `banned_ip.cfg`) are reloaded only when file `LastWriteTime` changes
  - Communication punishments (`communication_data.json`) are also reloaded on change detection
- **Why this is safer**:
  - closes timing/race windows where identity/IP arrives slightly later during connection
  - avoids expensive blind reloads each tick while still reacting quickly to manual edits

### 🎉 Version 1.0.3
